# Your-Day-Today
A snapshot of your daily relevant information


# User Story
Decision-making today is guided by efficiency and convenience; if there is a faster and easier way to do something, we will do it. For example, take a commuter who rides the train to and from work every day. He knows the workday is going to be busy and uses the train ride as an opportunity to prepare. The weather might differ from the station he boards at and his ultimate destination. The train ride however is spent doing much more than just worrying about the weather, it’s Monday morning and the stock market just opened after a nail-biting close on Friday. Even worse, at the end of the week, he is meeting a girl in another city for a date, but he has no plans for them that evening. Instead of cycling through several different sites and addressing one problem at a time, the commute can be spent much more efficiently. As a busy person trying to optimize their time, the commuter needs a one-stop shop for his information needs. Using this website allows the commuter to check the weather, keep track of his favorite stock tickers, plan a night out, get motivated with a daily quote, and much more all on one site. 


# What the website does
Hello and thank you for looking into our application! Before you dive in, here is a guide to help you fully understand all the aspects of our website:

When you first load in you are greeted with a beautiful header which has a search bar in the lower left corner. This search bar is what lets you input any city you want and will accordingly display the name of the city, current weather including temperature, humidity, UV Index, wind speed, and current cloud situation. It will also display a quick 5 day recap so you can have a glace at what the week will look like. if you look to the right of the weather box you will find a quick recap of the stock market at yesterdays closing and todays opening if available. We chose just to include some of the major stocks like the Dow jones 500 and the NASDAQ, but if the future this could be a more customizable feature where you can pick and sort through specific stocks tailored just for you. Below this we have a daily quote. This will display a motivational quote that can set you in the right mood for the day in front of you. Lastly we included a Ticketmaster powered widget that displays events or concerts within a 50 mile radius of the city that you entered in the header earlier. it is an interactive widget that has a carousel like feature allowing you to scroll from side to side until you find a fun activity fit to make any night great.
